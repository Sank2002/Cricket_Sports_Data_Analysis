Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging the power of Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization on cricket sports data. By utilizing Jupyter notebooks and popular Python libraries, we aim to uncover insights and patterns within the dataset.
Key Tasks

    Data Cleaning:
        Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data.
        Standardize data formats for consistency.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Explore statistical summaries and distributions of key variables.
        Identify trends, patterns, and outliers within the dataset.

    Data Visualization:
        Create meaningful visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
        Utilize libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for compelling visual representations.
